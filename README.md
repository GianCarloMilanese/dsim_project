# Digital Signal and Image Recognition project

# Project structure
The project is structured as follows:
- Audio: in this directory you will find all the notebooks and code related to the audio part. We chose to solve the following tasks: digit recognition (from 0 to 9) and speaker recognition (among the two of us, our girlfriends and 4 speakers in the free-spoken-digit dataset)
- Images: the equivalent of the previous directory but for the Image domain.
- Retrieval: you will find the notebook for finding which are the 10 VIP faces most similar to the current user

# Demos with the last models
## Alessandro

**Alessandro without glasses. Best Model: Basic model  with ~91% final accuracy**

## Alinda

**Best Model: Doublesteps with ~93% final accuracy**

## Camilla

**Camilla with glasses. Best Model: Basic model with ~43% final accuracy**

This seems to be the only case where the model's performance is very unsatisfactory (note that the models were not trained on pictures of Camilla wearing glasses)

## Khaled

**Best Model: Doublesteps with 100% accuracy**

## Luca

Luca's demos are interesting as the model was trained exclusively on pictures of him after he grew longer hair and beard than he is used to have, and he was very kind to provide videos before, after and while shaving.

**Luca before shaving. Best Model: basic model with ~72% final accuracy**

**Luca half shaved. Best Model: basic model with ~91% final accuracy**

# Older models and interesting/fun cases

## Model N. 20

Basic convolutional architecture, first model trained on heavily resized pictures (50x50 pixels)

**Ensemble picture**

**Flaw: Gian + hair on forehad = Mamma**

## Model N. 17

Model trained on fewer classes (Alinda, Cami, Gian, Khaled, Mamma, Papi)

**Prediction while walking under different lighting conditions**
